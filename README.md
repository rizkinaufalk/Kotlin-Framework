# Kotlin Project Structure

Hello everyone, My name is Kiki. I've been working as Mobile Android Developer for over 2 Years. I'm using Java for the whole my career as Android Developer. I know Kotlin become preferred language By Google since 2019. But, My current company doesn't said so :) because the complexity of our Business Flow project and we don't have time for it makes migrating to Kotlin is nearly impossible. This year, I want to stretch my brain for trying to keep up with the updated technology and feature. So i tried to make Kotlin Framework with updated library from our Java Framework.

Introduction
-------------

### Functionality
This Kotlin Framework is the bone of the app structure for my future application. My goal is to create a comfort, easy-to-use, and maintainable structure of apps. Of course I'm not create it from scratch. I mean, i'm not create this Framework by my self. I try combining from different sources like our Java Framework and another great work from medium and github contributor which i'm going to mention them with the link as a credit.
